# E-Commerce project
An e-commerce website is an online platform that allows businesses and individuals to buy and sell products or services over the internet. It acts as a digital storefront where customers can browse, select, and purchase items, often with a secure payment process. E-commerce websites are commonly used by a wide range of businesses, from small startups to large enterprises.
